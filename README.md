# SAPUI5 -- Table Maintenance 

## BE - BACK-END ABAP

## FE - FRONT-END SAPUI5 
The front end of this table maintenance for SAP Tables was developed in SAPUI5. 

I used 2 different views to implement the logic: 
1. sap.m table 
2. sap.smarttable. 

the sap.m.table can be adapted just by changing the model and definining the columns in the XML view. 

the sap.m.smartable requires the customizing of the EDMX file in XML to work.
